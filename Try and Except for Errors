####### Example of error

def div42by(divideby):
  try:
    return 42/divideby
  except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("there was the zero division error")
    
div42by(2)
div42by(10)
div42by(4)
div42by(0)
div42by(2)

# will print to a zero division error




###### FIXING THIS WITH A TRY/EXCEPT LINE
def div42by(divideby):
  try:
    return 42/divideby
  except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("there was the zero division error")
    
div42by(2)
div42by(10)
div42by(4)
div42by(0)
div42by(2)


# Will print properly


###### EXAMPLE 2

print("how many cats do you have?")
numcats = input()
if int(numcats) > 4:
  print("That is alot of cats")
else:
  print("That is not many cats")
  
#### if you were to enter a non interger here, it would error. However, try this below:

print("how many cats do you have?")
numcats = input()
try:
  if int(numcats) > 4:
    print("That is alot of cats")
  else:
    print("That is not many cats")
except ValueError:
  print("You did not enter a number")
