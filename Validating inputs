###### EXAMPLE 1

# Require string input isalpha()

input_check = False
    variable = input("There is a question here? ")
    while not variable.isalpha():
        variable = input("It cant be a number. Pick again ")


# Require a number input

input_check = False
    variable = input("There is a question here? ")
    while not variable.isnumeric():
        variable = input("It needs to be a number. Pick a number ")
    variable = int(variable)



###### EXAMPLE 2

print("how many cats do you have?")
numcats = input()
if int(numcats) > 4:
  print("That is alot of cats")
else:
  print("That is not many cats")
  
#### if you were to enter a non interger here, it would error. However, try this below:

print("how many cats do you have?")
numcats = input()
try:
  if int(numcats) > 4:
    print("That is alot of cats")
  else:
    print("That is not many cats")
except ValueError:
  print("You did not enter a number")
